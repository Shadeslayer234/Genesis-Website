      <p>Genesis is a platform as a service for deploying and running modern apps, built on a controlled container architecture with integrated data services and a powerful ecosystem. Genesis's developer experience is an app-centric approach to product delivery that is fully integrated with today's most common developer tools and workflows.</p>

      <p>Genesis runs your apps in dynos, which are smart containers that run in a safe, fully managed environment. Developers submit Node, Ruby, Java, PHP, Python, Go, Scala, or Clojure code to a build framework, which generates an app that is ready to run. The system and language stacks are constantly monitored, patched, and updated to ensure that they are still ready and current. The runtime keeps apps running without any manual intervention.</p>

    <div class="card flex">
      <i class="fas fa-plug fa-3x"></i>
      <p>The Genesis Developer Experience is an app-centric approach to software delivery that allows developers to concentrate on designing and delivering apps rather than worrying about servers or infrastructure. Developers use common tools including Git, GitHub, and Continuous Integration (CI) frameworks to deploy directly. The web-based Genesis Dashboard makes it simple to navigate and gain insight into your app.</p>

    <div class="card flex">
      <i class="fas fa-puzzle-piece fa-3x"></i>
      <p>Developers can use Genesis Elements to add Add-ons to their applications, customize their software stack with Buildpacks, and jumpstart their projects with Buttons. Add-ons are third-party cloud services that developers can use to quickly expand their apps with features like data stores, tracking, and monitoring. Three completely controlled data service Add-ons are available on Genesis: Genesis Postgres, Genesis Redis, and Apache Kafka on Genesis.</p>

      <p>Genesis is entrusted with sensitive data by developers all over the world, and nothing is more important to us than upholding our custodial obligations to protect this data. To further reinforce our customers' confidence, Genesis conducts routine audits and maintains PCI, HIPAA, ISO, and SOC compliance. Visit our enforcement center to learn more.</p>

      <p>The platform's Genesis Operational Experience is a critical part. It assists developers in rapidly identifying and addressing negative patterns in their application health by assisting them in troubleshooting and resolving common problems as well as customizing their ops experience. Genesis offers a range of tools to notify you if anything goes wrong, as well as to automatically scale your web dynos if the response time for web requests exceeds a certain threshold that the developer can specify. Some of the features you get for free include application metrics, threshold alerting, and autoscaling.</p>
